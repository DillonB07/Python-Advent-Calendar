	Welcome to the eleventh door! It's now Saturday 11th December, and so it is time for your eleventh Python challenge in this
	advent calendar. Your task is below:
</p>
<p>
	Although you've now created two encryption methods for Santa, it's time to make one for the elves! They don't want Santa
	hearing them! Create a program that uses one of the following ciphers to encrypt messages - <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher'
	 target='_blank'>Vig√©nere</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernam_cipher' target='_blank'>Veman</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher'
	 target='_blank'>Ceasar</a><br />
  Your program <strong>should</strong> do the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
        Use one of the above ciphers to decode user inputted messages
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
          Ignore numbers, symbols and whitespaces
      </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>However, you <strong>could</strong> add the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Code all of the encryption methods and let the user choose which one to use</p></li>
  <li>
      <p>
          Add a way to decrypt messages
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>Email the encrypted message to a friend(user-inputted address)
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Be unique! Instead of just using an unstyled Terminal window, make your
      program as a website, app or style the Terminal using the curses module.
      Or, just add colour, animation and clearing the screen!
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
