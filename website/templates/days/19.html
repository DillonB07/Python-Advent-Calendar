	Welcome to the nineteenth door! It's now Sunday 19th December, and so it is time for your nineteenth Python challenge in this
	advent calendar. Your task is below:
</p>
<p>
	Today, you get to make an AI! Create a program that you can talk to and it will give an appropriate response depending on what you say to it. You could make an elf, Santa or a reindeer. Or something completely different!
    <br />
  Your program <strong>should</strong> do the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Respond accurately</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Be christmasy</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>However, you <strong>could</strong> add the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Make it funny.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Save the data to a file and open it when the program restarts.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Be unique! Instead of just using an unstyled Terminal window, make your
      program as a website, app, voice assistant or style the Terminal using the curses module.
      Or, just add colour, animation and clearing the screen!
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
