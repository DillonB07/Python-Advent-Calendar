  Welcome to the sixth door! It's now Monday 6th December, and so it is time
  for your sixth Python challenge in this advent calendar. Your task is below:
</p>
<p>
  Santa wants to know what the weather will be like in a given location to prepare for his trip around the world on Christmas Eve. He would like you to make a program that uses a weather API and the requests module to find the weather at any location in the world. Here is a good API service, but you could use any others - <a href='https://openweathermap.org/api' target="_blank">OpenWeatherMap API</a>
  <br />
  Your program <strong>should</strong> do the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use the requests module to get data from an API.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Take user input for the city to get the weather for.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>Present the data from the API nicely instead of just printing out the JSON response.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>However, you <strong>could</strong> add the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Use other features from the API.</p></li>
  <li><p>Ask the user if they want to store the daya in a file</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Be unique! Instead of just using an unstyled Terminal window, make your
      program as a website, app or style the Terminal using the curses module.
      Or, just add colour, animation and clearing the screen!
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
