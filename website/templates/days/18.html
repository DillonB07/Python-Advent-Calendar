	Welcome to the eighteenth door! It's now Saturday 18th December, and so it is time for your eighteenth Python challenge in this
	advent calendar. Your task is below:
</p>
<p>
	All of these presents and necessities that need buying are expensive! Your job is to make a finance calculator that gets given a user-inputted budget. Then add up the entered finances and tell the user whether they're in debt or they have enough money.
    <br />
  Your program <strong>should</strong> do the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Accurately calculate finances.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Take a user-inputted budget</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>However, you <strong>could</strong> add the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Tell the user how much budget they have left.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Let the user take off items.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Save the data to a file and open it when the program restarts.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Be unique! Instead of just using an unstyled Terminal window, make your
      program as a website, app or style the Terminal using the curses module.
      Or, just add colour, animation and clearing the screen!
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
