  Welcome to the fifth door! It's now Sunday 5th December, and so it is time
  for your fifth Python challenge in this advent calendar. Your task is below:
</p>
<p>
  Christmas is a time where a lot of people like to buy things online. Therefore, cybercriminals are out to hack people's accounts and steal their passwords. Help users be safer by generating secure passwords for them.
  <br />
  Your program <strong>should</strong> do the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Generate random passwords with a length of 8-16 characters
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use a random combination of symbols, numbers, lowercase letters and uppercase letters.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>However, you <strong>could</strong> add the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Make a way for the user to remember their passwords(rhymes, songs etc).</p></li>
  <li><p>Ask the user if they want to store their password in a file</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Be unique! Instead of just using an unstyled Terminal window, make your
      program as a website, app or style the Terminal using the curses module.
      Or, just add colour, animation and clearing the screen!
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
