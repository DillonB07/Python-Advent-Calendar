# Python Advent Calendar

As I write this, December is rapidly approaching. How many of you are thinking about buying, or have already bought, an advent calendar? Probably quite a few. This is an advent calendar for Python users!

Each day will be unlocked at 7AM GMT via a Python script. Due to this being automatic, the JSON and HTML files with all of the tasks inside will be closed-source until I have some time to modify the gitignore after Christmas.
